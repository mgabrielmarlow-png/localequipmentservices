This is something I encountered early on.  See, what you got here is a big slow blow fuse, and they didn't have exactly the one I needed at the store, but it was basically the right one.  We got that compressor started back up and kept factory downtime to a minimum.  These are the scenarios that could break a lesser technician.

for this one the fan stopped spinning, so after verifying everything had power I put a new capacitor on there, but it still didn't work?  I reached my hand in there and realized that fan really didn't like to spin.  I replaced the motor, but kept those fan blades.

I don't mess with gas lines, but I got a girl Wanda I can call for that kind of work.

Here we have a nice little before and after.
<br>

  A prominent and delicious restaurant in Brookln got a brand new oven - an electric oven.  That was good for me, because like I said, I don't run gas line.  I wired that oven up, put a nice 12AWG SO cord on there with a NEMA L6-30P plug.  Ideally, and coincidentally, I found what seemed to be the perfectly unused existing run of 240V 30A going nearly where I wanted it. Ran a little conduit, put in a new box, an outlet, there you go.
